# mushroom-classifier

This project uses machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression; support vector; decision trees; random forests; and k-nearest neighbors.
The data is first cleaned and pre-processed. The most telling features are chosen to be used in the algorithms, and the data is transformed to one-hot encoding.
Each algorithm's success is represented by a confusion matrix, and the results are then analyzed.

To view the results, run the following notebook: `mushroom-classifier/mushroomClassifier/mushroomClassification.ipynb`.
Alternatively, just click on `mushroom-classifier/mushroomClassifier/mushroomClassification.ipynb` in github to render.
